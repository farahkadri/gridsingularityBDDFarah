I have used BDD Framework for this assignment.

Main Page -->gridsingularityproject\src\main\java\com\gridSingularity\pageObjects

Step Definition File -->gridsingularityproject\src\main\java\com\gridSingularity\stepdefinitions

Note- There are reports in this file, But  I havent used it for this project. Sure, we can use reports in long term.
I have used my mobile project reference for this assignment. Though, for mobile we had different drivers and I had used
appium for this.
